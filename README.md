# PFScraper -- Version 1.0.1
## Web Scraper and Automation tool for Practice Fusion
## Author: Alchael
## Language: Python (version 3.11)
## Prerequisites: bs4 and selenium

## How to use:
### 1. Install latest Python from python.org
### 2. Install external dependencies through pip:
### >>> pip install bs4
### >>> pip install selenium
### 3. Make sure input.csv and key.txt exists alongside pfscraper.py
### 4. Edit input.csv and key.txt before use
### 5. Run pfscraper.py

## What it does:
### It takes input.csv and goes through the list then grabs all those records from Practice Fusion and outputting the records into output.csv
### No need to worry about power outtages as the program appends to the file per line so it is continually saved.
### You really only need to worry about supplying the correct key.txt values
